## Loading and preprocessing the data

Show any code that is needed to

Load the data (i.e. read.csv())

Process/transform the data (if necessary) into a format suitable for your analysis

```{r, echo=TRUE}
read.csv(activity.csv)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
